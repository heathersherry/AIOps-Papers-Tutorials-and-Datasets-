## Papers
1. GRANO: Interactive Graph-based Root Cause Analysis for Cloud-Native Distributed Data Platform (VLDB 2019) [[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.14778/3352063.3352105)] ðŸŒŸ
> * Key points (from Sec 3): use graph modeling and propagation algorithm to measure the importance of detection events and minimize the effect of false positive alarms
> * Step 1 - Graph Construction, which forms a unified anomaly graph G = (V, E). V contains (1) the set of system components, and (2) the set of alarms and events retrieved. Each edge in E represents the interdependency between components.
> * Step 2 - Alarm Edge Scoring, which evaluates the alarmâ€™s importance to a connected system component.
> * Step 3 - Component Node Scoring, which calculates the aggregated confidence score on the components, using the criticality of the alarms and the edgesâ€™ score that connected to a component.
> * Step 4 - Score Propagation, which detects the actual root cause.
